# Conference Hub Framework Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation and guidelines for the Conference Hub application. It serves as a reference for developers, AI assistants, and stakeholders to understand the application's architecture, design principles, and development standards.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this framework documentation are:

1. **Knowledge Preservation** - Capture and maintain the core knowledge about the application's design and implementation
2. **Development Guidance** - Provide clear guidelines for implementing new features and maintaining existing code
3. **Onboarding** - Help new developers quickly understand the application's architecture and patterns
4. **Context for AI Agents** - Provide structured context for AI assistants working on the codebase

## Documents Overview

The framework documentation is organized into the following documents:

1. **[01-project-overview.md](./01-project-overview.md)** - High-level overview of the application, its purpose, and core features
2. **[02-user-personas.md](./02-user-personas.md)** - Detailed description of user personas and key user journeys
3. **[03-data-models.md](./03-data-models.md)** - Documentation of the application's data models and relationships
4. **[04-architecture.md](./04-architecture.md)** - Explanation of the application's architecture and component structure
5. **[05-development-roadmap.md](./05-development-roadmap.md)** - Current development status and future plans
6. **[06-coding-standards.md](./06-coding-standards.md)** - Coding standards and best practices for the project
7. **[07-supabase-integration.md](./07-supabase-integration.md)** - Details on how Supabase is integrated into the application
8. **[08-feature-implementation-guide.md](./08-feature-implementation-guide.md)** - Step-by-step guide for implementing new features

## How to Use This Framework

### For Developers

1. Start with the Project Overview to understand the application's purpose
2. Review the User Personas to understand the target users and their needs
3. Study the Architecture document to understand how the application is structured
4. Follow the Coding Standards when writing new code
5. Use the Feature Implementation Guide when adding new features

### For AI Assistants

1. Use these documents to build a comprehensive understanding of the application
2. Reference specific sections when providing guidance or implementing features
3. Ensure recommendations align with the established architecture and patterns
4. Adhere to the coding standards when generating code
5. Update these documents when significant changes are made to the application

### For Project Managers

1. Use the Project Overview to communicate the application's purpose to stakeholders
2. Reference the User Personas when discussing feature priorities
3. Consult the Development Roadmap for planning and status updates
4. Ensure new feature requests align with the established architecture

## Maintaining This Documentation

This framework documentation should be treated as a living resource that evolves with the application. When making significant changes to the application:

1. Update the relevant documentation to reflect the changes
2. Add new documents as needed for new major features or architectural changes
3. Review the documentation periodically to ensure it remains accurate and useful

By maintaining this documentation, we ensure that the Conference Hub application remains maintainable, scalable, and aligned with its original purpose and design principles.
