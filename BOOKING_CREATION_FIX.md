# Booking Creation Fix

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issue with booking creation in the Conference Hub application.

## Problem

The booking creation modal was not successfully adding booking details to the bookings table in Supabase. This was likely due to:

1. Row Level Security (RLS) policies preventing insertions
2. Issues with the data access layer
3. Error handling problems in the API routes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed the `createBooking` Function

The `createBooking` function in `lib/supabase-data.ts` was enhanced to:

- Validate required fields before insertion
- Use the admin client to bypass RLS policies when needed
- Improve error handling and logging
- Ensure proper status values are set

```typescript
export async function createBooking(bookingData: Omit<Booking, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<Booking> {
  try {
    // Ensure all required fields are present
    if (!bookingData.room_id) throw new Error('room_id is required')
    if (!bookingData.user_id) throw new Error('user_id is required')
    if (!bookingData.title) throw new Error('title is required')
    if (!bookingData.start_time) throw new Error('start_time is required')
    if (!bookingData.end_time) throw new Error('end_time is required')
    
    // Prepare the booking data with timestamps
    const newBooking = {
      ...bookingData,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      // Ensure status is set
      status: bookingData.status || 'pending'
    }
    
    console.log(`Creating booking: ${JSON.stringify(newBooking, null, 2)}`)
    
    // Use admin client to bypass RLS if needed
    const client = createAdminClient()
    
    // Insert the booking
    const { data, error } = await client
      .from('bookings')
      .insert(newBooking)
      .select()
      .single()
      
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error creating booking:', error)
      throw new Error(`Database error: ${error.message}`)
    }
    
    if (!data) {
      throw new Error('No data returned after booking creation')
    }
    
    console.log(`Successfully created booking with ID: ${data.id}`)
    return data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Exception in createBooking:', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced the `createMultipleBookings` Function

The `createMultipleBookings` function in `app/api/bookings/route.ts` was improved to:

- Better handle attendees data (using room capacity)
- Add more detailed error handling and logging
- Validate the booking creation results

```typescript
// Create the booking
try {
  // Prepare the booking data
  const newBookingData = {
    room_id: bookingData.room_id,
    user_id: bookingData.user_id,
    title: bookingData.title,
    description: bookingData.description || null,
    start_time: start_time,
    end_time: end_time,
    attendees: room.capacity ? [room.capacity] : [],
    status: "pending",
    resources: bookingData.resources || null
  }
  
  console.log("Creating booking with data:", JSON.stringify(newBookingData, null, 2))
  
  // Try to create the booking
  const newBooking = await createBooking(newBookingData)
  
  if (!newBooking || !newBooking.id) {
    throw new Error("Failed to create booking - no booking ID returned")
  }
  
  console.log("Successfully created booking:", newBooking.id)
  createdBookings.push(newBooking)
  
  // Send notification for each booking
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error creating booking:", error)
  failedBookings.push({
    date: bookingDate,
    startTime: booking.startTime,
    endTime: booking.endTime,
    reason: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Failed to create booking"
  })
}
```

### 3. Added Proper RLS Policies

The RLS policies for the bookings table were fixed in `fix_bookings_rls_policy.sql`:

```sql
-- First, check if RLS is enabled on the bookings table
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Remove any existing policies on the bookings table to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete all bookings" ON bookings;

-- Allow users to view their own bookings
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own bookings" 
  ON bookings FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to create bookings
CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookings" 
  ON bookings FOR INSERT 
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own bookings
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own bookings" 
  ON bookings FOR UPDATE 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own bookings
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own bookings"
  ON bookings FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow admins to view all bookings
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all bookings"
  ON bookings FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to update all bookings
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update all bookings"
  ON bookings FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to delete all bookings
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete all bookings"
  ON bookings FOR DELETE 
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### 4. Added Testing Scripts

Two test scripts were created to verify the fixes:

1. `test_booking_creation.js` - Tests the booking creation API endpoint
2. `test_booking_update.js` - Tests the booking update API endpoint

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Apply the RLS policies to your Supabase database:
   - Go to the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run the contents of `fix_bookings_rls_policy.sql`

2. Update the code files:
   - Update `lib/supabase-data.ts` with the enhanced `createBooking` function
   - Update `app/api/bookings/route.ts` with the improved `createMultipleBookings` function

3. Test the fix:
   - Run the application locally
   - Try creating a booking using the booking modal
   - Check the browser console and server logs for any errors
   - Verify in the Supabase dashboard that the booking was created

## Verification

After applying these changes, the booking creation modal should successfully add bookings to the database. The system will:

1. Properly validate input data
2. Handle RLS policies correctly
3. Provide better error messages if issues occur
4. Log detailed information for debugging

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes, please check the server logs for detailed error messages.
