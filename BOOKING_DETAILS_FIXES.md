# Booking Details Page Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Incomplete Data Fetching**
**Problem**: The `getBookingById` function only returned basic booking data without related information.

**Solution**: 
- Created `getBookingByIdWithDetails()` function that fetches comprehensive booking data with JOINs
- Includes room details, user information, facility data, payment information, and meeting invitation count
- Updated `BookingWithDetails` type to include all new fields

### 2. **Placeholder Values in Analytics**
**Problem**: Several hardcoded placeholder values were used instead of real data:
- Average check-in time: "2:05 PM" 
- Total amount: `(booking as any).total_cost || 0`
- Room utilization: `85`

**Solution**:
- Created `calculateAverageCheckInTime()` function to compute real average from meeting invitations
- Created `calculateRoomUtilization()` function to compute actual room usage over 30 days
- Updated analytics to use payment data from the comprehensive booking details

### 3. **Missing Data Relationships**
**Problem**: The page wasn't displaying all available related data.

**Solution**:
- Added facility information display in room details
- Enhanced organizer information with organization and position
- Improved payment details with comprehensive payment data
- Added check-in status section for bookings with check-in requirements
- Updated currency display to use actual payment/room currency
