# Email Notifications Implementation

This document describes the implementation of email notifications for booking approvals and rejections in the Conference Hub application.

## Overview

The system now automatically sends email notifications to users when facility managers take action on their booking requests:

- **Booking Approval**: When a facility manager approves a booking (status changes from "pending" to "confirmed")
- **Booking Rejection**: When a facility manager rejects a booking (status changes from "pending" to "cancelled")

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`app/api/bookings/[id]/status/route.ts`**
   - Added email notification logic to the booking status update API
   - Imports email service functions
   - Sends appropriate emails after successful status updates

2. **`lib/email-service.ts`**
   - Enhanced `sendBookingRejectionEmail` function to include date/time information
   - Improved email templates with better formatting and helpful information
   - Added optional date/time parameters to rejection email function

### Email Templates

#### Booking Confirmation Email
- **Subject**: "Booking Confirmed: [Booking Title]"
- **Content**: 
  - Confirmation message with booking details
  - Date, time, and room information
  - Important reminders for the meeting
  - Professional styling with green success theme

#### Booking Rejection Email
- **Subject**: "Booking Request Update: [Booking Title]"
- **Content**:
  - Rejection notification with booking details
  - Date, time, and room information (if available)
  - Rejection reason provided by facility manager
  - Instructions for submitting new requests
  - Professional styling with red warning theme

### Workflow Integration

The email notifications are triggered automatically when:

1. **Facility Manager Dashboard** (`/facility-manager`)
   - Manager clicks "Approve" or "Reject" on pending bookings
   - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental actions
   - API call updates booking status and triggers email

2. **Facility Manager Bookings Page** (`/facility-manager/bookings`)
   - Manager updates booking status through detailed interface
   - Can provide custom rejection reasons
   - API call updates booking status and triggers email

### Error Handling

- Email failures do not prevent booking status updates
- Comprehensive logging for debugging email issues
- Graceful fallback when user information is missing
- Validation of email addresses before sending

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup Email Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env.local file
   SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_SECURE=false
   SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
   EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Conference Hub
   EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@conferencehub.com
   ```

2. **Test Booking Approval**
   - Create a booking request as a regular user
   - Login as facility manager
   - Approve the booking from dashboard or bookings page
   - Check that confirmation email is received

3. **Test Booking Rejection**
   - Create a booking request as a regular user
   - Login as facility manager
   - Reject the booking with a reason
   - Check that rejection email is received with reason

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-email-notifications.js
```

**Note**: Update the test email address in the script before running.

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# Required for email functionality
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Conference Hub
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@conferencehub.com
```

### Email Service Providers

The implementation works with any SMTP-compatible email service:

- **Gmail**: Use App Passwords for authentication
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Use standard SMTP settings
- **SendGrid**: Use SMTP relay
- **Amazon SES**: Use SMTP interface
- **Custom SMTP**: Any standard SMTP server

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Log Messages

The system provides detailed logging for email operations:

- `üìß [API] Attempting to send email notification for booking {id}`
- `‚úÖ [API] Booking confirmation email sent successfully to {email}`
- `‚ùå [API] Failed to send email notification for booking {id}`

### Common Issues

1. **SMTP Configuration**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. **Authentication**: Ensure SMTP credentials are valid
3. **Firewall**: Check that SMTP ports are not blocked
4. **Rate Limits**: Some providers have sending limits

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are validated before sending
- No sensitive information is logged
- SMTP credentials are stored securely in environment variables
- Email failures don't expose system internals to users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the email notification system:

1. **Email Templates**: Move to external template files for easier customization
2. **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages
3. **Rich Content**: Add calendar attachments (.ics files)
4. **Delivery Tracking**: Track email delivery status
5. **User Preferences**: Allow users to opt-out of certain notifications
