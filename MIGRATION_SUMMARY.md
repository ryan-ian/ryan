## Database Migration Steps

To apply the database changes, run the SQL migration script in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `database/migrations/001_rename_department_to_organization.sql`
3. Verify the migration completed successfully

## Testing Checklist

After applying the migration:

- [ ] Test user signup with organization input
- [ ] Test user profile updates
- [ ] Test admin user management
- [ ] Verify existing users display organization correctly
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify all user interfaces show "Organization" instead of "Department"

## UI Changes

### Before:
- Signup form had a dropdown with predefined departments (Marketing, Sales, Engineering, etc.)
- User profiles and admin interfaces displayed "Department"

### After:
- Signup form has a text input for "Organization" where users can enter their company/organization name
- All user interfaces now display "Organization" instead of "Department"
- Placeholder text: "Enter your organization name" / "Acme Corporation"

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a breaking change that requires:
1. Database migration to rename the column
2. All code changes to be deployed simultaneously
3. Existing users will have their department field renamed to organization

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:
1. Revert all code changes
2. Run reverse migration: `ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN organization TO department;`
3. Update the trigger function to use `department` again

## Notes

- The change maintains backward compatibility in terms of data (just renames the field)
- All validation and security policies remain the same
- The field is still required for user signup
- Existing user data is preserved, just accessed via new field name
