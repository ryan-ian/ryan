- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All TypeScript types resolved
- ✅ Realtime functionality ready for testing

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Manual Testing**

1. **Open Multiple Browser Tabs**:
   - Navigate to facility manager dashboard in one tab
   - Navigate to user bookings in another tab
   - Create a new booking and watch real-time updates

2. **Test Booking Flow**:
   - User creates booking → Manager sees instant notification
   - Manager approves → User sees instant status update
   - Verify toast notifications appear

3. **Test Connection Status**:
   - Watch for green "Live" indicator in headers

4. **Test Notifications**:
   - Click bell icon to open notification panel
   - Verify unread count updates
   - Test notification dismissal

### **Browser Notification Testing**

1. Grant notification permissions when prompted
2. Create booking requests to trigger notifications
3. Verify browser notifications appear for important events

## 📋 Maintenance Notes

### **Monitoring**
- Monitor Supabase realtime usage in project dashboard
- Track connection success rates
- Watch for subscription cleanup issues

### **Troubleshooting**
- Check Supabase project status if connections fail
- Verify RLS policies if updates aren't received
- Ensure proper cleanup if memory usage increases

## 🎯 Next Steps
