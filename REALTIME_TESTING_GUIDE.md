- ✅ **Real-time pending requests counter** that updates automatically
- ✅ **Live connection status indicator** showing realtime connectivity
- ✅ **Browser notifications** for new booking requests (with permission)
- ✅ **Automatic dashboard refresh** when bookings change
- ✅ **Immediate pending list updates** when new requests arrive
- ✅ **Today's bookings updates** when bookings are confirmed for today

### **Facility Manager Bookings Page** (`/facility-manager/bookings`)
- ✅ **Real-time booking list refresh** without page reload

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: New Booking Request Flow**

**Setup:**
1. Open two browser tabs:
   - Tab 1: Facility Manager Dashboard (`/facility-manager`)
   - Tab 2: Facility Manager Bookings (`/facility-manager/bookings`)

**Test Steps:**
1. **Create a new booking request** (as a regular user):
   - Navigate to `/conference-room-booking`
   - Create a new booking request with status "pending"

2. **Observe real-time updates**:
   - **Dashboard Tab**: Watch for instant notification and counter increment
   - **Bookings Tab**: See new booking appear in the list immediately
   - **Both Tabs**: Notice "new" badges appear with animation
   - **Browser**: Check for browser notification (if permission granted)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Pending requests counter increments immediately
- ✅ New booking appears in pending requests list
- ✅ "New" badge shows with pulsing animation
- ✅ Toast notification appears
- ✅ Browser notification shows (if permissions granted)
- ✅ Updates appear in ALL open tabs simultaneously

### **Scenario 2: Booking Status Change Flow**

**Setup:**
1. Ensure you have pending booking requests from Scenario 1
2. Keep both facility manager tabs open

**Test Steps:**
1. **Approve a booking** from either the dashboard or bookings page
2. **Observe real-time updates**:
   - Booking disappears from pending list immediately
   - Counters update automatically
   - If booking is for today, it appears in "Today's Schedule"
   - Status changes reflect in both tabs instantly

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Booking removed from pending list immediately
- ✅ Pending counter decrements
- ✅ Today's bookings counter increments (if applicable)
- ✅ Status updates appear in all tabs
- ✅ No page refresh required

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Tab Synchronization**

**Setup:**
1. Open 3+ browser tabs with facility manager pages:
   - Tab 1: Dashboard
   - Tab 2: Bookings page
   - Tab 3: Another dashboard instance

**Test Steps:**
1. Create multiple booking requests rapidly
2. Approve/reject bookings from different tabs
3. Observe synchronization across all tabs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All tabs update simultaneously
- ✅ Counters stay synchronized
- ✅ "New" badges appear consistently
- ✅ No conflicts or inconsistencies

### **Scenario 4: Connection Status Testing**

**Setup:**
1. Open facility manager dashboard
2. Observe the "Live" connection indicator

**Test Steps:**
1. **Normal Operation**: Verify green "Live" indicator
2. **Network Interruption**: Disconnect network briefly
3. **Reconnection**: Reconnect and observe automatic reconnection

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Green "Live" indicator during normal operation
- ✅ Status changes to "Disconnected" during network issues
- ✅ Automatic reconnection when network restored
- ✅ "Reconnecting..." status during reconnection attempts

### **Scenario 5: Browser Notification Testing**

**Setup:**
1. Ensure browser notifications are enabled
2. Open facility manager dashboard

**Test Steps:**
1. **Grant Permission**: Allow notifications when prompted
2. **Create Booking**: Submit a new booking request
3. **Observe Notification**: Check for browser notification

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Permission request appears on first visit
- ✅ Browser notification shows for new booking requests
- ✅ Notification includes booking details (user name, room)
- ✅ Notification appears even when tab is not active

## 🔧 Manual Testing Instructions

### **Using the Application Interface**

1. **Login as Facility Manager**:
   - Use admin credentials to access facility manager features
   - Navigate to `/facility-manager` dashboard

2. **Create Test Bookings**:
   - Open a new incognito window or different browser
   - Login as a regular user
   - Navigate to `/conference-room-booking`
   - Create multiple booking requests

3. **Monitor Real-time Updates**:
   - Switch back to facility manager tabs
   - Observe instant updates without refreshing
   - Test approval/rejection workflows

### **Using Browser Developer Tools**

1. **Monitor Network Activity**:
   - Open Developer Tools → Network tab
   - Look for WebSocket connections to Supabase
   - Verify real-time events are received

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for real-time event logs:
     - `🏢 New booking request received:`
     - `🏢 Booking status changed:`
     - `🔄 Refreshing dashboard data...`

3. **Test Connection Resilience**:
   - Use Network tab to simulate offline/online
   - Verify automatic reconnection

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **No Real-time Updates**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Supabase connection status
   - Ensure user has admin role
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Missing Browser Notifications**:
   - Verify notification permissions are granted
   - Check browser notification settings
   - Ensure HTTPS connection (required for notifications)

3. **Inconsistent Updates**:
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console
   - Verify all tabs are using the same user session

4. **Connection Status Issues**:
   - Check Supabase project status
   - Verify environment variables are correct
   - Test with different network connections

### **Debug Information**

**Console Logs to Look For:**
```
✅ [Manager Realtime] Successfully subscribed to booking changes
🏢 New booking request received: [booking object]
🔄 Refreshing dashboard data...
📋 [Bookings Page] New booking request received: [booking object]
```

**Network Tab Indicators:**
- WebSocket connection to Supabase Realtime
- Real-time event messages
- Successful subscription confirmations

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**

1. **Update Latency**: Time from booking creation to UI update
2. **Connection Stability**: Frequency of disconnections/reconnections
3. **Memory Usage**: Ensure no memory leaks from subscriptions
4. **Battery Impact**: Monitor on mobile devices

### **Expected Performance**

- **Update Latency**: < 1 second for real-time updates
- **Connection Stability**: > 99% uptime under normal conditions
- **Memory Usage**: Stable, no continuous growth
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal on mobile devices

- Multiple browser types and versions
- Different network conditions (WiFi, mobile, slow connections)
- Various device types (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Extended usage periods (no memory leaks or performance degradation)
- High-frequency booking creation (stress testing)
