# TypeScript Import Fixes - Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: TypeScript import errors for newly added functions in the facility manager booking details page.

**Root Cause**: An outdated compiled JavaScript file (`lib/supabase-data.js`) was interfering with the TypeScript module resolution.

## Actions Taken

### 1. **Identified Missing Functions**
Confirmed that the following functions were properly exported in `lib/supabase-data.ts`:
- ✅ `getBookingByIdWithDetails` (line 921)
- ✅ `calculateAverageCheckInTime` (line 3024) 
- ✅ `calculateRoomUtilization` (line 3066)

### 2. **Removed Conflicting JavaScript File**
- **Deleted**: `lib/supabase-data.js` (outdated compiled version)
- **Reason**: The JavaScript file was missing the new function exports, causing import resolution to fail

### 3. **Cleared Next.js Cache**
- Removed `.next` directory to clear any cached compilation artifacts
- Ensured fresh compilation of TypeScript files

### 4. **Verified Import Resolution**
- Confirmed all imports work correctly in `app/facility-manager/bookings/[bookingId]/page.tsx`
- Development server starts without compilation errors
- TypeScript diagnostics show no issues

## Current Status

### ✅ **Working Imports**
```typescript
import {
  getBookingByIdWithDetails,
  calculateAverageCheckInTime,
  calculateRoomUtilization
} from "@/lib/supabase-data"
```

### ✅ **Function Usage**
All functions are properly called in the booking details page:
- `getBookingByIdWithDetails(bookingId)` - Fetches comprehensive booking data
- `calculateAverageCheckInTime(booking.id)` - Calculates real check-in times
- `calculateRoomUtilization(booking.room_id)` - Calculates room utilization

### ✅ **Development Server**
- Server starts successfully on port 3001
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Ready for testing and development

## Files Affected

1. **Removed**: `lib/supabase-data.js` (conflicting compiled file)
2. **Verified**: `lib/supabase-data.ts` (all exports present)
3. **Verified**: `app/facility-manager/bookings/[bookingId]/page.tsx` (imports working)

## Next Steps

The TypeScript import errors have been resolved. The booking details page should now:

1. **Load without errors** - All function imports resolve correctly
2. **Display real data** - Functions fetch actual database information
3. **Show accurate analytics** - No more placeholder values

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to a booking details page in the facility manager interface
2. Verify that all data displays correctly (no "undefined" or placeholder values)
3. Check that analytics show real calculated values
4. Confirm payment information displays with correct currency
5. Validate that room utilization shows actual percentages

The import issues have been successfully resolved and the application should now function as expected.
