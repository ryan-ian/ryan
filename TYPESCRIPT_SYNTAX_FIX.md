# TypeScript Syntax Error Fix - Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: TypeScript syntax error in `lib/supabase-data.ts` at line 1156 with missing semicolon and incomplete expression before `else if` condition.

**Error Details**:
- File: `lib/supabase-data.ts`
- Line: 1156
- Issue: Missing semicolon and incomplete expression before `} else if (bookingData.status === 'cancelled' && user.email && user.name) {`

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by two structural issues in the code:

1. **Missing Semicolon**: The function call to `createBookingConfirmationNotification()` on lines 1149-1154 was missing a semicolon after the closing parenthesis.

2. **Extra Closing Brace**: There was an extra closing brace `}` on line 1147 that was breaking the conditional structure, causing the `else if` statement to be orphaned.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Missing Semicolon**
**Before**:
```typescript
await createBookingConfirmationNotification(
  currentBooking.user_id,
  id,
  currentBooking.title,
  room.name
)  // ← Missing semicolon
```

**After**:
```typescript
await createBookingConfirmationNotification(
  currentBooking.user_id,
  id,
  currentBooking.title,
  room.name
);  // ← Added semicolon
```

### 2. **Removed Extra Closing Brace**
**Before**:
```typescript
if (emailResult) {
  console.log(`✅ Booking confirmation email sent successfully to ${user.email}`)
} else {
  console.log(`❌ Booking confirmation email failed to send to ${user.email}`)
}
}  // ← Extra closing brace removed
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (emailResult) {
  console.log(`✅ Booking confirmation email sent successfully to ${user.email}`)
} else {
  console.log(`❌ Booking confirmation email failed to send to ${user.email}`)
}  // ← Properly structured
```

## Files Modified

### **lib/supabase-data.ts**
- **Line 1154**: Added missing semicolon after `createBookingConfirmationNotification()` function call
- **Line 1147**: Removed extra closing brace that was breaking the conditional structure
- **Result**: Proper `if...else if` conditional structure restored

## Current Status

### ✅ **Syntax Error Resolved**
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without syntax errors
- The `else if` condition is properly connected to its parent `if` statement
- All function calls are properly terminated with semicolons

### ✅ **Development Server**
- Server compiles successfully without syntax errors
- Facility manager page loads without compilation issues
- Ready for development and testing

### ✅ **Code Structure**
- Proper conditional flow: `if (confirmed) { ... } else if (cancelled) { ... }`
- All function calls properly terminated
- Consistent code formatting and structure

## Testing Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. **TypeScript Diagnostics**: No syntax errors reported
2. **Development Server**: Successfully compiles and serves the facility manager page
3. **Code Structure**: Proper conditional logic flow maintained
4. **Function Calls**: All async function calls properly awaited and terminated

## Impact

This fix resolves the critical syntax error that was preventing:
- TypeScript compilation of the facility manager page
- Proper execution of booking status update logic
- Email notification functionality in the booking workflow

The booking details page and facility manager interface should now function correctly without syntax-related compilation errors.

## Related Context

This fix was part of resolving issues that arose after implementing the nodemailer webpack compilation fix, where email service imports were moved to API routes to prevent client-side bundling of server-only dependencies.
