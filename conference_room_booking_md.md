## Architecture

The proposed system is a multi-tenant, cloud-native application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using **FastAPI** for the backend and **Firebase (Firestore)** for the database. Users interact via a responsive web or mobile interface (hosted on Firebase Hosting or CDN) and tablets mounted outside rooms (running a kiosk app). The high-level architecture connects clients (Web/Mobile/Tablet) through secure API endpoints to FastAPI services (deployed on Cloud Run or App Engine), with **Firestore** as the primary data store. **Firebase Authentication** (with Google and Microsoft OAuth) secures user access and issues role-based tokens. External services include Google Calendar API and Microsoft Graph API for calendar sync, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) plus email for notifications. Auxiliary components handle analytics (BigQuery/Looker), CI/CD (Cloud Build), and monitoring (Cloud Monitoring/Logging). Real-time room status updates and check-ins are powered by Firestore's real-time listeners and event triggers.

### Clients (Web/Mobile/Tablet)
Users book and manage rooms via a web or mobile app (SPA) and via tablets at room entrances. The UI is responsive and built with a framework like React or Flutter. Static assets are served via Firebase Hosting/CDN. The tablet app (in kiosk mode) shows current room status and allows check-in/out. Both clients use Firebase Auth for login and connect to the backend APIs and/or Firestore.

### Authentication & RBAC
We use **Firebase Authentication** for SSO. Users can sign in with Google or Microsoft accounts (OAuth providers), and new accounts are created in Firebase Auth. FastAPI verifies incoming JWT tokens on each request. Role-based access is implemented with Firebase custom claims: e.g., users can have roles like *Admin*, *Manager*, *Employee*. Custom claims in the ID token (set by an Admin service) control permissions in Firestore Security Rules and FastAPI endpoints. Guests or external users receive time-limited tokens with limited scope. Access to sensitive operations (e.g. room CRUD) is checked against these roles.

### Backend Services
The core backend is a FastAPI service (containerized). Key components include:

- **Booking Engine**: Handles scheduling logic. It validates availability, creates/modifies/cancels bookings, and prevents conflicts. We implement conflict detection by querying existing bookings for overlapping time ranges (e.g. atomic Firestore transactions or scheduling algorithms). On booking, the engine triggers notifications and calendar sync.

- **Notification Service**: Using Firebase Cloud Functions (or Cloud Run jobs), we listen for new or updated bookings in Firestore. Functions send push notifications via FCM and email reminders (e.g. using SendGrid). A scheduled function can handle reminder alerts before meeting start. Notifications are configurable per user and room. We also trigger analytics events for reporting.

- **Calendar Sync**: On each booking create or update, FastAPI calls external Calendar APIs. For Google Calendar, we use the Google Calendar REST API (creating/updating events in the user's or room's calendar). For Outlook, we call Microsoft Graph Calendar APIs similarly. Users authorize our app via OAuth; service accounts or backend credentials write events. This keeps external calendars in sync with the room booking data.

- **Real-Time Hub**: Firestore acts as a real-time data channel. For example, the tablet apps listen to the room's Firestore document: when a booking becomes active or a user checks in, the UI updates instantly (no polling). FastAPI can also open WebSocket connections (via Starlette) for events, but Firestore listeners on the client side handle most UI updates efficiently.

- **Resource Management**: Admin interfaces (FastAPI-protected) allow creating/editing rooms, buildings, and equipment (e.g. projectors). The Firestore data model has collections like locations, rooms (with fields for capacity, features, zone), and resources. Bookings reference rooms and optionally linked resources.

### Data Model (Firestore)
We use a document-oriented schema. Key collections:

- **users**: each doc stores profile and role claims (role fields can be duplicated here for quick UI access)
- **locations**: offices or campuses, each with multiple rooms
- **rooms**: each doc includes locationId, capacity, amenities, timezone, and a nested sub-collection bookings
- **bookings**: either as a subcollection under each room or a top-level collection with fields userId, roomId, start, end, recurringRule, status, resources[]. We also index on (roomId, time range) for efficient conflict checks
- **resources**: shared items (e.g. video conference kits) that can be added to a booking
- **analytics**: write-audit logs or aggregate usage data (optionally via Firestore exports to BigQuery)

Firestore's flexible schema lets us store user preferences (e.g. calendar tokens) and status flags. We ensure each booking doc stores times in UTC with the room's timezone metadata. Multi-location is handled by locationId and geolocation tags. The database design follows NoSQL best practices (denormalizing for read performance).

### API Design (REST)
FastAPI exposes RESTful endpoints (also possible GraphQL layer) for all operations. Example endpoints:

- `POST /auth/login` (token issued via Firebase Auth)
- `GET /rooms`, `POST /rooms` (admin)
- `GET /rooms/{id}/availability?start=...&end=...`
- `POST /bookings`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /bookings/{id}`
- `POST /bookings/{id}/check-in` (triggered by tablet or mobile)
- `GET /users/me/calendar-sync` (initiate calendar integration)

FastAPI uses Pydantic models for request/response. Security schemes (OAuth2/JWT) are declared in the OpenAPI spec. Swagger UI can be enabled for exploration.

### Real-Time Communication
To reflect changes instantly (e.g. when someone checks in, or a cancellation occurs), we leverage Firebase's real-time listeners. Tablet and user clients subscribe to relevant Firestore documents/queries. For server-to-server events (e.g. backend triggers), we use **Cloud Pub/Sub** or **Firebase Cloud Messaging**. For instance, when a booking status changes, a Cloud Function publishes to a "booking-updates" topic; interested services (or devices via FCM) receive a push. This decouples components and scales naturally.

### Tablet Integration
Each meeting room tablet runs a client app (web or native). It knows its roomId and authenticates with a service account or shared key. The app listens to Firestore to display current/next meeting, and shows "Check-In" button for active meetings. When a user taps Check-In, the app calls `POST /bookings/{id}/check-in`. This updates Firestore (e.g. setting checkedIn=true), which triggers real-time UI update (even on other clients). If no check-in occurs within a grace period, the backend can auto-release the room (via a scheduled function). The tablets may also report occupancy (optional IoT integration).

### Notifications & Reminders
The system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications to mobile devices, and SMTP/SendGrid for email. On booking creation, FastAPI enqueues a notification (via Pub/Sub or direct call to a Cloud Function) to inform attendees. Reminder jobs (e.g. 10 minutes before start) are scheduled via Cloud Scheduler or a Firestore expiration trigger, sending push/emails. Alerts for booking changes or cancellations likewise go through this notification service.

### Analytics & Reporting
Booking and usage data is periodically exported to BigQuery (e.g. via scheduled Cloud Function or Firestore export). We compute metrics like room utilization, peak hours, no-show rates, etc. Dashboards in Looker Studio or Grafana display trends (e.g. bookings per week, occupancy by department). Logs from FastAPI and Cloud Functions are aggregated in Cloud Logging for audit. Custom metrics (average response time, booking queue size) feed into Cloud Monitoring charts.

### Security & Access Control
All API endpoints require authentication tokens. We enforce HTTPS everywhere. FastAPI verifies Firebase ID tokens (OIDC) using Google's libraries. Role-based rules in Firestore Security Rules and FastAPI decorators restrict actions (e.g. only Admin role can create rooms). Data is isolated per organization or location by including tenantId or locationId filters. Sensitive info (like calendar tokens) is encrypted (Cloud KMS for credentials). The system runs inside a VPC with Private Service Connect; we optionally use Cloud Armor (WAF) and Identity-Aware Proxy for the backend APIs.

### Scalability & Fault Tolerance
Firestore and Cloud Run auto-scale. Firestore is a managed, globally replicated database (we choose a regional instance near our users). Cloud Run automatically scales instances of the FastAPI container based on load. We use Cloud Load Balancing + CDN for web front-end. Caches (Cloud CDN or in-memory) speed up common queries (e.g. room lists). We avoid single points of failure: multiple FastAPI instances, redundant Cloud Functions, and multi-AZ Firestore. Data is backed up via scheduled exports. GCP's auto-healing and 99.99% SLA ensure high availability. When usage spikes (e.g. start of day), horizontal scaling and careful indexing handle throughput.

### Multi-Region/Location Support
Each office location is tracked in data. We use Firestore locations or separate instances if needed. The frontend auto-detects user location or office context. Time zones are stored per room and all times are handled in UTC on the backend.

### CI/CD Pipeline
We set up automated pipelines using **Google Cloud Build**. On every commit/merge to the main branch, Cloud Build runs tests and builds Docker images. It then deploys the API to Cloud Run (or updates App Engine). Frontend code (React/Vue) is built and deployed to Firebase Hosting. Cloud Build can integrate with GitHub/GitLab and supports canary or blue-green deploys. We store infrastructure as code (Terraform or Deployment Manager) for repeatable environments. Cloud Build's built-in triggers and integrations make this smooth.

### Monitoring & Alerting
Using **Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver)**, we collect metrics (CPU, memory, request latency) from FastAPI/Cloud Run and Cloud Functions. We set alert policies: e.g. high error rate (>1% 5xxs), high latency (>300ms), or low database availability. Alerts notify via email/Slack. Log-based alerts catch specific failure messages. Dashboards show API performance and booking throughput. Logging of all API requests (structured logs) helps in diagnostics. This observability ensures issues (e.g. calendar API failures) are caught early.
