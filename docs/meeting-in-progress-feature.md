# Meeting in Progress Feature

## Overview

The room display system now differentiates between bookings that haven't been checked into ("occupied") and meetings that are actively in progress ("meeting-in-progress"). This provides clear visual communication to people walking by the room about the current meeting status.

## Status Types

### Before Check-in
- **"occupied"** - Room is booked but user hasn't checked in yet
- **"reserved"** - Room will be needed soon (15-minute window before start time)

### After Check-in
- **"meeting-in-progress"** - User has successfully checked in, meeting is actively happening

### Other Statuses
- **"available"** - No current booking
- **"maintenance"** - Room is temporarily unavailable

## Visual Changes

### Status Colors
- **Available**: Green (emerald-500)
- **Occupied**: Blue (sky-500) 
- **Meeting in Progress**: Purple (purple-500) - NEW
- **Reserved**: Amber (amber-500)
- **Maintenance**: Red (red-500)

### Layout Changes
When a meeting is in progress, the display switches to a special layout:

1. **Prominent Meeting Card** - Large card at the top showing:
   - "Meeting in Progress" header with LIVE badge
   - Meeting title (large, bold)
   - Meeting description
   - Duration and time range
   - Organizer information
   - Privacy notice

2. **Secondary Information** - Smaller grid below with:
   - Today's schedule
   - Status ring and clock
   - Room actions and information

## Components Updated

### New Components
- `MeetingInProgressCard` - Prominent display of active meeting information

### Updated Components
- `RoomStatusIndicator` - Added "meeting-in-progress" status type
- `StatusBadge` - Added purple styling for meeting-in-progress
- `StatusRing` - Added purple color and glow for meeting-in-progress
- `app/displays/[roomName]/page.tsx` - Updated status logic and layout

## Status Logic

```typescript
// In the display page component
if (current) {
  // Check if the current booking has been checked in
  if (current.checked_in_at) {
    setRoomStatus("meeting-in-progress")
  } else {
    setRoomStatus("occupied")
  }
} else if (room?.status === "maintenance") {
  setRoomStatus("maintenance")
} else if (next && isWithinInterval(now, {
  start: addMinutes(parseISO(next.start_time), -15),
  end: parseISO(next.start_time)
})) {
  setRoomStatus("reserved")
} else {
  setRoomStatus("available")
}
```

## Database Requirements

The feature requires the `checked_in_at` column in the `bookings` table. This is added by the check-in migration SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS checked_in_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

## User Experience

### For People Walking By
- **Clear Status**: Immediately see if a meeting is actively happening vs. just booked
- **Meeting Details**: Understand what type of meeting is in progress
- **Duration Info**: Know how long the meeting is scheduled to run
- **Privacy Respect**: Visual cues encourage quiet behavior during active meetings

### For Meeting Organizers
- **Check-in Confirmation**: Visual feedback that check-in was successful
- **Meeting Visibility**: Their meeting information is prominently displayed
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern display enhances meeting professionalism

## Testing

Run the test script to verify status logic:
```bash
node scripts/test-meeting-status.js
```

All test scenarios pass:
- ✅ Booking without check-in → "occupied"
- ✅ Booking with check-in → "meeting-in-progress"  
- ✅ No current booking → "available"
- ✅ Reserved window → "reserved"
- ✅ Maintenance status → "maintenance"

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the check-in SQL** in Supabase to enable the database function
2. **Test the check-in flow** to ensure `checked_in_at` is properly set
3. **Verify the display** shows "Meeting in Progress" after successful check-in
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - Add meeting attendee count display
   - Include meeting room resources being used
   - Add estimated end time countdown
   - Implement meeting extension requests
