## 2.1 Literature Review and Competitive Analysis

The field of workspace management and room booking systems has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by technological advancement and changing workplace dynamics. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of existing solutions, examining their architectural approaches, feature sets, and limitations to establish the context for the Conference Hub system development.

### 2.1.1 Market Landscape and Evolution

The global meeting room booking systems market has experienced substantial growth, with industry reports indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4% from 2021 to 2028 [1]. This growth is attributed to the increasing adoption of smart office technologies, the rise of hybrid work models, and the need for efficient space utilization in corporate environments.

Research by Gartner (2023) indicates that 78% of organizations consider workspace optimization a critical component of their digital transformation initiatives [2]. The market has evolved from simple calendar-based booking systems to sophisticated platforms incorporating IoT integration, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics capabilities.

### 2.1.2 Theoretical Foundations

The development of workspace management systems is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:

**Space Syntax Theory**: Developed by Hillier and Hanson (1984), this theory provides the foundation for understanding how spatial configuration affects human behavior and movement patterns in built environments [3]. Modern booking systems leverage these principles to optimize room placement and accessibility.

**Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**: Davis's (1989) model explains user adoption of technology systems, emphasizing perceived usefulness and ease of use as primary factors [4]. This framework is crucial for designing intuitive booking interfaces that encourage user adoption.

**Resource-Based View (RBV)**: Barney's (1991) strategic management theory provides the foundation for understanding how organizations can leverage workspace resources as competitive advantages [5]. This perspective informs the development of analytics and optimization features in modern booking systems.
