# Admin Panel Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Admin Panel of the Conference Hub application. The Admin Panel will serve as the central control hub for administrators, allowing them to manage users, facilities, and monitor system health.

## Pages to Implement

### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/admin/conference/dashboard`)

#### Components
- **SystemStatsCards**: Display total users, facilities, and active bookings
- **RecentActivityFeed**: Show recent significant events
- **UsageCharts**: Display booking trends and user growth

#### Data Requirements
- User count from users table
- Facility count from facilities table
- Active bookings count from bookings table
- Recent activity logs (user sign-ups, facility additions)
- Historical booking data for trend charts
- User registration data for growth charts

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create dashboard layout with responsive grid for stats cards
2. Implement data fetching hooks for system statistics
3. Create activity feed component with pagination
4. Implement chart components using a library like Chart.js or Recharts
5. Set up real-time or polling updates for dashboard data

### 2. User Management (`/admin/conference/users`)

#### Components
- **UserTable**: Sortable, searchable table of all users
- **AddUserModal**: Form for creating new users
- **EditUserModal**: Form for editing user details and roles
- **ConfirmationDialog**: For critical actions like role changes

#### Data Requirements
- Complete user list with name, email, role, and status
- Role definitions (user, facility_manager, admin)
- User creation and update APIs

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create user table component with sorting, filtering, and pagination
2. Implement "Add User" button and modal form with validation
3. Create "Edit User" functionality with pre-populated form
4. Implement role assignment dropdown with confirmation for critical changes
5. Add account activation/deactivation toggle with status update
6. Set up form validation for all user inputs

### 3. Facility Management (`/admin/conference/facilities`)

#### Components
- **FacilityTable**: List of all facilities with assigned managers
- **AddFacilityModal**: Form for creating new facilities
- **EditFacilityModal**: Form for editing facility details
- **ManagerSelector**: Dropdown for assigning facility managers

#### Data Requirements
- Complete facility list with names and assigned managers
- List of eligible facility managers (role = 'facility_manager' AND not assigned to another facility)
- Facility creation and update APIs

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create facility table component with sorting and filtering
2. Implement "Add Facility" button and modal form
3. Create specialized manager selector component that:
   - Fetches users with 'facility_manager' role
   - Filters out managers already assigned to facilities
   - Displays appropriate messaging when no eligible managers exist
4. Implement "Edit Facility" functionality with pre-populated form
5. Set up validation for facility data

### 4. Reports & Analytics (`/admin/conference/reports`)

#### Components
- **DateRangeSelector**: For filtering report data
- **RoomUtilizationReport**: Display most/least used rooms
- **BookingTrendsChart**: Show booking patterns over time
- **ExportDataButtons**: For downloading CSV reports

#### Data Requirements
- Room booking statistics aggregated by room/facility
- Time-based booking data for trend analysis
- Export-ready formatted data for users and bookings

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create date range selector component for filtering reports
2. Implement room utilization report with sorting options
3. Create booking trends charts with time-based filters
4. Implement data export functionality for CSV generation
5. Set up data transformation utilities for report formatting

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state (auth, theme)
- Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and mutations
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### API Integration
- Create dedicated API client functions for each data operation
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API response types

### Authentication & Authorization
- Ensure all admin routes are protected with role-based access control
- Verify 'admin' role for all sensitive operations
- Implement proper token handling and session management

### UI Components
- Use Shadcn UI components as the foundation
- Implement responsive designs for all pages
- Create consistent loading and error states

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation for all forms
- Server-side validation for all API endpoints
- Proper error messaging for validation failures

## Database Schema Updates

No schema changes are required as the existing tables should support:
- Users table with role field
- Facilities table with facility_manager_id field
- Bookings table for usage statistics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure and Dashboard
- Set up admin layout and navigation
- Implement dashboard with static data
- Create basic routing structure

### Phase 2: User Management
- Implement user table with CRUD operations
- Create role management functionality
- Set up account status toggling

### Phase 3: Facility Management
- Implement facility table with CRUD operations
- Create manager assignment logic
- Set up facility-manager relationship enforcement

### Phase 4: Reports & Analytics
- Implement basic reporting components
- Create data visualization charts
- Set up CSV export functionality

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- Connect all components to live data
- Implement error handling and edge cases
- Perform comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical business logic (e.g., manager eligibility)
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical admin functions

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all forms are keyboard navigable
- Add proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Test with screen readers
- Implement proper focus management for modals

## Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Use virtualization for long lists
- Optimize API calls with batching and caching
- Lazy load components where appropriate

## Security Considerations
- Ensure proper authorization checks for all admin operations
- Implement audit logging for sensitive actions
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
