- `03_booking_workflow_step1.png`
- `04_mobile_responsive_design.png`

### 3.2 Documentation Integration Format
Insert screenshots using the following markdown format:

```markdown
![Figure X.X: Screenshot Description](screenshots/filename.png)
*Figure X.X: Detailed caption explaining the screenshot content and its relevance to the system functionality.*
```

### 3.3 Figure Numbering
Continue the existing figure numbering sequence:
