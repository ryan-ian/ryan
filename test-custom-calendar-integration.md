# Custom Calendar Integration Test

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Extracted Custom Calendar from Booking Creation Modal
- Extracted the complete custom calendar implementation from `app/conference-room-booking/bookings/booking-creation-modal.tsx`
- Includes all key features:
  - Custom table-based rendering
  - Booked dates highlighting
  - Past date restrictions
  - Month navigation
  - Proper accessibility attributes

### 2. Replaced Calendar in Booking Edit Modal
- Removed the Shadcn UI Calendar component from `components/bookings/booking-edit-modal-modern.tsx`
- Replaced with the custom `CustomCalendar` component
- Maintained all existing modal structure and functionality

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Custom Calendar Features:
- **Table-based rendering**: Uses HTML table structure for better control
- **Month navigation**: Previous/next month buttons
- **Date restrictions**: Automatically disables past dates and today
- **Booked dates display**: Shows user's existing bookings with visual indicators
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Visual consistency**: Matches the original design from creation modal

#### Edit Modal Specific Adaptations:
- **Current booking highlighting**: Shows the booking being edited as "booked" but still selectable
- **Auto-close behavior**: Calendar closes automatically after date selection
- **Error handling**: Proper validation for past dates
- **Visual feedback**: Orange highlighting for booked dates, blue for selected dates

### 4. Integration Details

#### State Management:
```typescript
const [userBookedDates, setUserBookedDates] = useState<Date[]>([])
```

#### Calendar Usage:
```typescript
<CustomCalendar
  selected={currentSelectedDate || undefined}
  onSelect={handleDateSelect}
  className="rounded-md"
  bookedDates={userBookedDates}
/>
```

#### Date Selection Handler:
- Updated to work with custom calendar (expects `Date` not `Date | undefined`)
