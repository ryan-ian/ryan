### Pages to Redesign:

   - Login page
   - Signup page
   - User login page

2. **Main User Pages**
   - Home/Dashboard
   - Conference room booking main page
   - Room listings page
   - Room detail page
   - New booking creation page
   - Booking details page
   - User profile page

3. **Admin Pages**
   - Admin dashboard
   - Room management pages (listing, detail, edit, new)
   - Resource management pages (listing, detail, edit, new)
   - Booking management pages (listing, detail)
   - User management pages

### Components to Redesign:

1. **Layout Components**
   - Main layout
   - App sidebar/navigation
   - Header/navigation bar
   - Footer

2. **UI Components**
   - Cards (room cards, booking cards, resource cards)
   - Forms (booking form, resource form, room form)

The redesign would involve creating a cohesive design system with:

- Animation guidelines
- Responsive layout rules

Would you like me to proceed with the redesign of any specific page or component first, or would you prefer a comprehensive design system approach?
